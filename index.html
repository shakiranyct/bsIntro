					<p>	In Shakira’s spare time, she tends to draw a lot both digitally and traditionally. She loves drawing her own characters and making stories for them she even includes her characters in class assignments<br>
					<br>
					Shakira’s middle school, Mountain View School has once set up her art on their board in the school to celebrate how good of an artist she is, they asked her questions for her board to teach others about having fun hobbies that could lead somewhere else. <br>
					<br>
					Hence why Shakira’s favourite class in Cardston High school was art, Shakira’s family always told her that she was really good at drawing, although in the beginning her mother was more disturbed by the gore aspects of her art.<br>
					<br>
					The first time Shakira tried to improve her art skills was in grade 6, her best friend at the time had been her motivation because she was amazing at art and Shakira thought that was so cool.
